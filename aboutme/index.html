      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        Hello, my name is Yi-Ting Lin. I come from Taiwan, a small island in Asia.
        I've been in US since 2015 summer, the reason I came to US is that I'd like to
        explore my life and experience the differnt culture and new things. I hope I can
        find a job about website management or database management, so I still cannot
        decide my specialization.
      </p>
      <h3>Personality</h3>
      <p>
        I am kind of shy, but when you get to know me then maybe you'll have different opinions about me.
        I'm not a talkative person, but I have the patience to listen. welcome to talk with me if you need someone to listen to you.
      </p>
      <h3>Interests</h3>
      <p>
        I like to watch Japanese animations and live game on Youtube.
